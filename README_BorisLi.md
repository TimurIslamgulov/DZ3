# Personal information

- Name: Boris Li
- Age: 42
- Current country of residency: Russia

# Current occupation
- From July 2022 - IT student in [GeekBrains](https://gb.ru) online school. Persevering in the new area of knowledge for me. Planning to make IT programming one of my major areas of expertize in the next 2-3 years.

# Previous (pre-IT) occupations
- **From 2017 to 2022** - Stock Exchange trading and investing as a retail investor. Exploited several stock exchange trading approaches from good old traditional long-term investments to an algorithmic speculative trading. 

   Geopolitical events of 2022 have ruined Russian stock exchange market as well as served as one of the bear market triggers on stock exchage markets globally. While many investors may treat such situation as good opportunity to enter cheapened market, I believe that geopolitics at the present is prevailing factor of Russian financial market and as such it brings an unbearable amount of uncertainty to it, it kills liquidity and even volatility of this market.
   And while I still do believe in foreign markets and I keep trading and investing on those markets, I decided to shift my focus to persueing new area of expertize.

- **From 2002 to 2017** - Wireline Logging Engineer in a transnational corporation, the leader in oil and gas service area. The last four years of that occupation was spent in the North Sea of United Kingdom. Serving in oil and gas was an unforgettable period of my life and wireline logging was an adventurous and enjoyable occupation until this job demand to take up all your time, thus creating big disbalance between work and personal life, became unbearable.
At the time i did not see the benefit of moving from one oil & gas domain to another, therefore decided to leave this industry altogether.

# Personal interests
- **Running** - a good way of meditation and settling down the swarm of thoughts at the end of busy day:). I have a longstanding intention to master full marathon distance. However, it is in the form of my dreams yet. Or my plans I should say, as I'm certain that I will achieve this goal one day.
- **Travelling** - Being a lying seal on a resort beach is preferable type of travel:), however I'm a lover of active anventures too. The interest that becomes less and less affordable in the surrounding environment, unfortunately.
- **Other** trivial types of joys from having a beer with friends to spending TV watching evenings with my family.

# The aim of achieving new expertize in IT

IT industry expansion these days is exponential and it will continue developing this way in foreseeable future. Having an expertize in IT gives you a greate flexibility in terms of place where you want to live as well as it offers competitive level of income. 
These are the major factors which align with my needs. I would like to achieve sufficient level of financial independence to be able to choose freely which apartment, city or country I *would like to* live (as opposed to "*have to*") and which kind of life style I would like to have. That is, of course, without being too issusive about my capabilities and too naive about what the level of opportunities this inductry can offer to me.
