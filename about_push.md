Here belowe are some short explanations of commands used to download and upload remote repositories:

**git clone (link to remote repository)** - *creates a clone of remote repository on your device*

**git pull** - *downloads remote repository and merges it with one currentlly used on device*

**git push** - *uploads repository from device to remote repository*

IMPORTANT NOTE: after clonning of remote repository it is required to change directory (without it git will try to call directory which doesn't exist). Need to call **cd (name of directory from downloaded repository)**
